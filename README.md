# Real-time Markdown editor

## Description

A real-time markdown editor is a web-based tool that allows users to write text in Markdown format and instantly see the rendered output as HTML or formatted text. It provides a live preview of the content while users type, making it easier to create and format documents, notes, or posts with markdown syntax. These editors typically feature a split-screen interface, with one side for the raw Markdown code and the other for the live preview, offering an efficient and user-friendly experience for users who need to generate styled content quickly.
